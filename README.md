# Race Problem in COVID Vaccination Data
In this document, I discuss two articles about the race and ethnicity problem reflected in the data of COVID-19 vaccine recipents in the United States.

## Article 1
In the Washington Post's [Race and ethnicity data missing for nearly half of coronavirus vaccine recipients, federal study finds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/01/covid-vaccine-race-ethnicity-data/) , Akilah Johnson reports that the report of coronavirus vaccine recipients from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is missing race and ethnicity information for nearly half of all recipents. This huge gap in ethnicity data has led to an increased concern about ensuring an equitable response to the pandemic in the United States.

Similar to the vaccination report, a lack of race and ethnicity data has also persisted among the reports on COVID-19 diagnosis reports. In fact, the disease has been spreading among people of color at higher rates. Black, Latino and Native American/Alaska Native people are up to 3.6 times more likely than White people to be hospitalized due to COVID-19.

While the government is working on standardizing the data that needs to be collected during vaccincation, insufficiency in race and ethnicity data remains an urgent problem for the United State's fight against COVID-19.

## Article 2
In Eyewitness News's [New NYC COVID data shows "profound problem" with vaccination rate of Black residents](https://abc7ny.com/nyc-covid-vaccine-coronavirus-updates-update/10192895/), a great disparity on coronavirus vaccine distribution in New York City was carefully illustrated with data.

Mayor Bill de Blasio pointed out that communities of color have demonstrated a profound problem of distrust and hesitancy towards vaccines and COVIS-19 policies. Based on the new data released by New York City, 40% of vaccine recipients did not provide racial data and the current data has a racial breakdown of 48% white, 15% Asian, 15% Latino and 11% Black. The mayor is expanding priority zones and will look to broaden its outreach and education to address vaccine hesitancy, prioritize appointments, and add new vaccine sites.

The tendency that distrust and hesitancy among the Black community are higher than Latinos, than Asians, and than whites is said to be anticipated. However, the current efforts in vaccine education and advertising campaign are obviously far from enough. Amid COVID-19, the problem of inequality deeply rooted in the healthcare system has been exacerbated and needs stronger incentives for making changes.
